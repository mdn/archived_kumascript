  <td><code>acceleration</code></td>
  <td><a href="/en-US/docs/DOM/DeviceAcceleration">DeviceAcceleration</a></td>
  <td>The acceleration of the device. This value has taken into account the effect of gravity and removed it from the figures. This value may not exist if the hardware doesn't know how to remove gravity from the acceleration data. Read only.</td>

  <td><code>accelerationIncludingGravity</code></td>
  <td><a href="/en-US/docs/DOM/DeviceAcceleration">DeviceAcceleration</a></td>
  <td>The acceleration of the device. This value includes the effect of gravity, and may be the only value available on devices that don't have a gyroscope to allow them to properly remove gravity from the data. Read only.</td>
